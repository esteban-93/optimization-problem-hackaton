# optimization-problem-hackaton
Here we face a problem of calculating boxes dimentions starting from measurements such as weight, density and volume.
The problem was adressed through optimization using a very popular package called Pyomo to modelling. 

There is a code in charge of the training using historical data, as soon as we have the coeficients, 
the linear model is tested with another portion of unseen data. 

## Installation
Use the package manager pip to install the requirements

```bash 
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
